  <h1>Hi, I'm Mila!</h1>
  <h4>a curious, customer-centric, and a team player designer.</h4>
  <p>Recently I'd love to learn about design strategy and structural thinking while honing my crafting skills. Currently working at core design team in Bukalapak, maintaining it's design system.</p>
  <br>
  <p>A short story. One sunny day in a UX Designer biweekly meeting, a designer created a game. He asked us to write an application that we loved the most and the reason why. I instantly wrote Spotify, because I love how I experience my weekly routine clicking discover weekly and discover artists from other artists. I adore how Spotify lets me explore my love for music with ease. Honestly, that would be the main reason I applied for the job.</p>
