  <h1>Hi, I'm Mila!🌻</h1>
  <h4 class="space-down-24">a curious, customer-centric, and a team player designer.</h4>
  <p>Currently working at core design team in Bukalapak, maintaining it's design system. This year, I'm focus learning about design strategy and structural thinking while honing my crafting skills.</p>
  <br>
  <p>A short story. One sunny day 🌞 in a UX Designer biweekly meeting, a designer created a game. He asked us to write an application that we loved the most and the reason why. I instantly wrote Spotify, because I love how I experience my weekly routine clicking discover weekly and discover artists from other artists. I adore how Spotify lets me explore my love for music with ease and enable me to create emoji based playlists 😎 (I think the recommender could be better😋). Honestly, that would be the main reason I applied for the job.</p>
