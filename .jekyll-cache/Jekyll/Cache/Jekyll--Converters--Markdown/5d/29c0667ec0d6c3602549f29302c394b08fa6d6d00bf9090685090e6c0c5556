	<p class="paragraph">I worked at design system team as a product designers collaborate with 2 designers and 8 engineers for almost one year. When I started, the design system only have base component, having a hard time to catch up 40+ product squads who consume it and wish to scale the system through collaboration and contributions. <br /> Below are the highlight of my work at the design system team</p>

	<span class="body--smaller-bold">Challenges<br /></span>
	<p>From 3 designers and 3 engineers I interviewed, I found that</p>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-24">Product teams invented non-reusable new components, at the same time need to reuse other product component</p>
	<span class="body--smaller">Reason</span>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-24">They feel like if they use bazaar components, it is not necessarily optimized for their product-specific needs. At the same time our system also is not designed to make squads accustomed to working on components by themself and share it with each other.</p>
	<span class="body--smaller">Consequence<br /></span>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-42">Unintentional component divergence that can't be reused directly, have a risk to be a system debts in the future since when an update is made it will not get affected and lessen cohesiveness since they work in silo</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
	<span class="body--smaller-bold">Objective<br /></span>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-42">Enable system users create and use each other components by themself</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
	<span class="body--smaller-bold">Outcome<br /></span>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-42">1. A family design system model, with guild library as the place for system users to put their sharable components</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-24">2. Cadence and service to support system users coordinate and create cohesive components</p>
	<p class="body--bolder">Build a governance system</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-24">The core team manages bazaar token and library and system users manage the guild library. Each of us can contribute to one library or another.</p>
	<p class="body--bolder">Recruite ambassador as the bridge</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-42">
	Responsible to facilitate component collaboration inside the guild, maintain the quality of guild library and connect guild with core team. To collaborate closely with us, I arrange ambassador weekly check-in to exchange knowledges about design systems and product experiences

<div class="container">
	<span class="body--smaller-bold">Impact<br /></span>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-12">1 migration projects, and 15 reusable components are in progress to be add to our system</p>
	<p class="paragraph">After almost two months, some components were added to our new system. We also get a good sign of enthusiasm from our team:
	“I’m excited working on my guild library” - a guild ambassador
	“Hey, I think this component can be a guild component” - a squad engineer</p>

	<h2 class="title-post space-down-24">Design and facilitate<br />component creation</h2>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-80">I design components ranging from molecule to pattern, provide the process for designers to create components and facilitate global component design co-creation.</p>
