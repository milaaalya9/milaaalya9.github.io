I"* <p class="section-porto space-up-16">Bazaar is Bukalapak’s Design System enable easier collaboration to make a cohesive experience and scalable products for Bukalapak. I was one of three designers in the design system team. In this project, mainly responsible to coordinate and execute the system transformation supervised by the head of design</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Problem background</p>
	<h3>With 40+ products, that keeps on growing, our system is having a hard time catch up </h3>
	<p>After one year with a centralized model where Core Bazaar Team makes components, we observe the system have been stale and encounter problems. The signal is our team which is low in number can’t keep up with products demands that keep on increasing.</p>	
</div>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Understanding system user problems</p>
	<h3>System users feel Bazaar components are not sufficient and invent non-reusable new components</h3>
	<p>I interviewed 3 engineers and 3 designers to understand their current struggle. I found out system users..</p>
	<li>Feel like using components that not necessarily optimized for their product-specific needs  and decided to create their own component in feature. Thus resulting in tons of component divergence that can't be reused directly.
	</li>
	<li> Want to reuse components from other squads that are not in Bazaar. So, they copy-paste the code, and this is not scalable when update is made.</li>
	Our system also is not designed to make squads accustomed to working on components by themself and share it with each others.

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Objective and key results</p>
	<h3>We want to enable system users create and use each other components</h3>
	<p class="space-down-24">With all the insights on our hands, we regrouped and align on the objective. As for the key result is have a system and service that able to increase reusable and cohesive components in our system. After knowing what we want, all the coordination and execution were my responsibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Process crafting the system</p>
	<h3>I explored scalable component models</h3>
	<p>The design question is “How might we enable squads to reuse each other components?”. I investigated the design of our products and discovered some products trying to solve similar problems and have similar patterns. I conclude it will be good if squads in a group strive solve the same problem hand by hand, in a model that we provided. Thus I propose the 1st type new group library and the 2nd type the group of groups library to the team, and we assessed them together based on technical, design, and people aspects.
	<br />
	We choose the 2nd type because the potential components in each them and ratio of people working on it is optimal. I proceed to create the theme and check whether our hypothesis is right.</p>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Test the model</p>
	<h3>Validated the model by conducting workshops</h3>
	<p>To check whether the theme will have reusable and optimize specific components, I conducted two workshop. First, with design system designers, we collected product screens in one group as a sample and jotted down which components that can be optimized and used together. We found a lot, and it’s interesting as mostly it was a molecule component.
	<br />
	Second, to verify does each theme will have reusable components, I facilitated a workshop with all of ux designers as the participants. The result, each theme have components. After this, we are confident in moving forward with the project.</p>

	<h3>I delivered process, coordinate ambassadors and communicate the system changes</h3>
	<p>Next, I need to think about how might we enable people to adopt the new design system structure and created a good component independently?</p>
	<br />
	<b>Build Process</b>
	<br />
	<p>I Ideated and deisgn the procees with the help of our team. For designer, I co-created framework to discover reusable components and principles to create components. For engineer we make sure the process from handoff design to code area smooth, where and how squad engineer put their component, the review process, and how the core team can monitor the system.</p>
	<br />
	<b>Recruit Ambassador</b>
	<br />
	<p>We recruite a designer as design system ambassador for each theme. They responsible to facilitate collaboration inside the guild or with core team, and maintain the quality of guild library.  To collaborate closely with us, I arrange ambassador weekly check-in and sharing knowledge of components in the first month they joined.</p>
	<br />
	<b>Communication strategy</b>
	<p>
	I took some time designing how to communicate the new design system to the whole company with the help of the head of design. We thought about the terms, explain it in function biweekly, and other media such as chat, email with video attached. We don’t want anyone to miss the information.

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">An overview of the new Bazaar Ecosystem</p>
	<h3>Bazaar now consists of 3 fundamental elements, with the presence of Guild library</h3>
	<p> The first element is Bazaar token inherently constitutes Bukalapak as a brand through typography, color and other base elements. Then, the one that we usually use, Bazaar library - A collection of common components which shared across products in Bukalapak.
	<br />
	The new one is Guild library, A collection of specific components that is being used by a certain group of products/features with similar requirements or user problems to solve. Currently we have 8 Guilds with around 10 products in the guild. When a guild need other guild component, the component will be transform into Bazaar library components
	<br />
	Those elements is managed with governance system where core team manage bazaar token and library and system users manage the guild library. Each of us can contribute to one library or another. To enable guild library we also have Bazaar Ambassador as the driver.
	</p>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Outcome</p>
	<h3>Several components were added to our system, more components are on progress!</h3>
	<p>After almost two months, some components were added to our new system. We also get a good sign of enthusiasm from our team:
“I’m excited working on my guild library” - a guild ambassador
“Hey, I think this component can be a guild component” - a squad engineer
	</p>
</div>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">ongoing work</p>
	<h3>Increasing the guild library adoption with guild initiatives</h3>
	<p>In an effort to have a cohesive product, we need to tidy up the old messy components. I am working with the ambassadors and their managers on creating a strategy to improve their design components and aligning it with the product squad timeline, so they can ship it to users and have a massive, incremental impact.

	<p class="section-subheader">Main takeaway</p>
	<h3>Zooming in and out throughout the process has helped me navigate in this project that was filled with abstraction. </h3>
	<p>I am very grateful that my head gave me the opportunity to lead this project as I touch a lot of areas that are new to me. In the journey, I sometimes lost whenever I go in too deep. I’m glad that I know whenever I get lost, I need to zoom out and find a helpful resource. </p>
