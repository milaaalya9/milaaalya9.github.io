	<p class="section-subheader">Problem background</p>
	<h3>Heuristicly the team believe there are room to improve in their buying journey</h3>
	<p>It takes several unnecessary steps for restaurant to constantly purchase their stocks in Stoqo android application (which the common platform that user used) while fixing that problem is the main goal of this project, the stakeholders decided to expand the scope of the project to be finding current applications problems which have significant impact for user, prioritize and find a way to solve it.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Understanding restaurant owner needs</p>
	<h3>Restaurant owners usually purchase more than 1 item in one checkout and they do it periodically but we have not address the need</h3>
	<p>I Interviewed user by phone and spoke with the team that has high-intensity interaction with users which are the acquisition and customer service team to get user problems. I also analyze current usage from the data funnel tracker. From the data, I can know where the user drops and the pattern of the user journey.
	<br />
	I discovered, Users usually purchase more than 1 item in one checkout. The problem is, to add a product to cart user need to open the product first, itâ€™s cost one step that is not necessary because most of the time, in their second purchase they already know the details. Restaurants also stock their items by purchasing them periodically and they canâ€™t figure out how to repeat their purchases.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Solution</p>
	<h3>A capital loan aggregator</h3>
	<p class="space-down-24">Our team decided to build a platform providing various loan offers from different trusted providers, so sellers can choose the fund they needed in one place.</p>	
	<b>Objective</b>
	<p class="space-down-16"> Enable sellers get the fund they needed with shorter process and and a higher chance to be approved, so they can elevate their business.</p>
	<b>Success metrics</b>
	<li> 
	Number of sellers get a capital loan from our platform </li>
	<li> 
	The revenue we receive from partners based on loan disbursed amount</li>

	<p class="section-subheader">Process in crafting the design</p>
	<h3>I facilitated whiteboarding co-creation, design, and iterate it based on various feedbacks</h3>
	<p>Together with PM, APM, and the Researcher we created the user flow in the whiteboard. After consolidating our favorite wire flow, I sketch wireframe design to demonstrate product value propositions that matched seller needs. I consulted multiple times to the product and business team, to make sure it was suitable for the business model since Fintech has a tight regulation.
	I proceeded to created high-fidelity prototype. Later, I gathered another round of feedback from other designers, the team, stakeholders, and partners. In pararell, the researcher and I conducted usability and concept testing to 5 sellers. After the testing, I revised the design based on issues finding before handing it to the engineering team.</p>

	<h3>The key designs</h3>
	<img src="/assets/image/porto/bukamodal-2.png" class="full-width" />
	<b>Landing page</b>
	<p class="space-down-16">Above the fold, I highlighted what they can do with additional fund, and a recommendation button as the call to action that will take them to know the  potential amount they can get based on their selling transaction. I also sneak peeks 3 of benefit using our platform that reflects sellers' current struggles in getting funded.</p>	
	<b>Loan listing</b>
	<p class="space-down-16">Sellers have a lot of things to consider, and to compare offers easily, I decided to display the main information in the card, summarize secondary information in accordion, and put details that are less important &amp; will not contribute to the choosing process in a link to another page. The design enables them to compare in one page.</p>
	<b>Application form</b>
	<p class="space-down-16">The application form is quite challenging because it requires users to input a lot of data and itâ€™s hard to avoid. As I thought it will be overwhelming for user to fill it all at one go, I divided the KYC forms into three processes with 1 scroll for each forms to make it feel short in term of number of steps and questions per-page and user can get small win in each steps.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Outcomes</p>
	<h3>One quarter after the release, the product had disbursed 2X (Twice) total loan amount of the business team manual proof of concept projectâ€™s amount generated.</h3>
	<p>A seller testimonies who get the fund they needed to grow their business</p>
	<p>"Quite good, the process is quick from entering data for submission, until sending it to partners. The capital is also useful to help fund sales turnover "</p>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Main takeaway</p>
	<h3>I wish Iâ€™d collaborated with engineers and partners earlier to have scalable design</h3>
	<p> I got feedback from engineers when the design was almost finished. As the consequences, in technical system design, we have kinda lousy structured and need to refactor them later. Working on a financial technology product that highly regulated needs multiple alignments with multidisciplinary teams, from legal to the data security department. I wish I get an invite to the partners meeting earlier to get align effeciently.</p>
