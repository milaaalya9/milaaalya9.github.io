I"ñ<p>I canâ€™t believe I finished coding my website. A welcome notes.</p>

<p>I have been dreaming of having my website, code by myself from the last semester of college. But itâ€™s hard to finish one. Here it is, the output of my intense googling CSS skill in 4 days during the weird pandemic era.</p>

<p>The actual plan of the website is to showcase my work portfolio, but I gotta start with the most enjoyable part first, which is casual blogging. You will find some writing about things that Iâ€™m interested in here, which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design, mostly my learning in UX but I also want to explore more than that</li>
  <li>Craft and Art, I love to do this on the weekend</li>
  <li>Social issues, I decided focusing my attention to child, women, and environmental issue</li>
  <li>Learning takeaway from books and event that I attend to</li>
  <li>Life lesson, a reflection notes from my personal experiences.</li>
</ul>

<p>For me, the actual goals of blogging are</p>

<ul>
  <li>Structuring my thought through writing</li>
  <li>Level up my writing and English skill, my linguistic skill is quite poor (like in every language), and English proficiency is a must to survive</li>
  <li>I also would love to see my personal view growth through my writing</li>
</ul>

<p>By writing this post, I hope I can be hold responsible to constantly writing (2 week for 2 writing) and learning.</p>

<p>In the middle of 2020 grief with a lot of failed plan, I wish to move on and embrace the uncomfortable situation.</p>
