I was one of three designers in the design system team. In this project, mainly responsible to coordinate and execute the system transformation supervised by the head of design</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Problem background</p>
	<h3>With 40+ products, that keeps on growing, our system is having a hard time catch up </h3>
	<p>After one year with a centralized model where Core Bazaar Team makes components, we observe the system have been stale and encounter problems. The signal is our team which is low in number can’t keep up with products demands that keep on increasing.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Understanding system user problems</p>
	<h3>System users feel Bazaar components are not sufficient and invent non-reusable new components</h3>
	<p>I interviewed 3 engineers and 3 designers to understand their current struggle. I found out system users..</p>
	<li>Feel like using components that not necessarily optimized for their product-specific needs  and decided to create their own component in feature. Thus resulting in tons of component divergence that can't be reused directly.
	</li>
	<li> Want to reuse components from other squads that are not in Bazaar. So, they copy-paste the code, and this is not scalable when update is made.</li>
	Our system also is not designed to make squads accustomed to working on components by themself and share it with each others.

	<p class="section-subheader">Objective and key results</p>
	<h3>We want to enable system users create and use each other components</h3>
	<p class="space-down-24">With all the insights on our hands, we regrouped and align on the objective. As for the key result is have a system and service that able to increase reusable and cohesive components in our system. After knowing what we want, all the coordination and execution were my responsibility.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Process crafting the system</p>
	<h3>I explored a scalable component models</h3>
	<p>The design question is “How might we enable squads to reuse each other components?”. Thinking of scalability, I came up with two concepts family of design systems. I investigated the design of our products and discovered some products trying to solve similar problems and have a similar pattern. I conclude it will be good if squads in a group strive to strengthen each other component solutions and solve the same problem hand by hand. Thus I propose the 1st type new group library and the 2nd type the group of groups library to the team, and we assessed them together based on technical, design, and people aspects.
		<br />
	We choose the 2nd type because the potential components in each them and ratio of people working on it is optimal. I proceed to create the theme and check whether our hypothesis is right.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Test the model</p>
	<h3>Validated the model by conducting workshops</h3>
	<p>To check whether the theme will have reusable and optimize specific components, I conducted two workshop. First, with design system designers, we collected product screens in one group as a sample and jotted down which components that can be optimized and used together. We found a lot, and it’s interesting as mostly it was a molecule component.
	Second, to verify does each theme will have reusable components, I facilitated a workshop with all of ux designers as the participants. The result, each theme have components. After this, we are confident in moving forward with the project.</p>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Main takeaway</p>
	<h3>I wish I’d collaborated with engineers and partners earlier to have scalable design</h3>
	<p> I got feedback from engineers when the design was almost finished. As the consequences, in technical system design, we have kinda lousy structured and need to refactor them later. Working on a financial technology product that highly regulated needs multiple alignments with multidisciplinary teams, from legal to the data security department. I wish I get an invite to the partners meeting earlier to get align effeciently.</p>
