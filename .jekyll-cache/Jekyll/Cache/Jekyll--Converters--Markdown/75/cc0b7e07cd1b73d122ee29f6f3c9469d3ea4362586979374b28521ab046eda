	<p style="margin-block-start: 0;">
	Currently working as a UX designer in design system team at Bukalapak. I am passionate to learn about strategic product design, especially on social and business aspects. I have this huge curiosity on how design can bring impact to issues I care about: women &amp; children's rights and environmental sustainability. 
	</p>
	<p>
	While that is my main interest, in 2020 I will focus on honing my 'abstract to concrete' thinking and visual design skill. 
	</p>
	<p>
	When I'm not designing, I'm probably gardening, crafting art, reading, or watching Korean drama.  I'm on my journey to build my own studio room at home, simply because I love art tools and art itself even though I'm not that good at creating ones (also because of the pandemic).  
	</p>
	<p>
	I'd love to chat about design and all the things related to my interests. Feel free to nudge me on my twitter.
