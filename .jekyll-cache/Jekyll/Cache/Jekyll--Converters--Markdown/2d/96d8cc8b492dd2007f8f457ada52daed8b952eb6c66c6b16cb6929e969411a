	<p class="section-subheader">Problem background</p>
	<h3>Heuristicly the team believe there are room to improve in their buying journey</h3>
	<p>It takes several unnecessary steps for restaurant to constantly purchase their stocks in Stoqo android application (which the common platform that user used) while fixing that problem is the main goal of this project, the stakeholders decided to expand the scope of the project to be finding current applications problems which have significant impact for user, prioritize and find a way to solve it.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Understanding restaurant owner needs</p>
	<h3>Restaurant owners usually purchase more than 1 item in one checkout and they do it periodically but we have not address the need</h3>
	<p>I Interviewed user by phone and spoke with the team that has high-intensity interaction with users which are the acquisition and customer service team to get user problems. I also analyze current usage from the data funnel tracker. From the data, I can know where the user drops and the pattern of the user journey.
	<br />
	I discovered, Users usually purchase more than 1 item in one checkout. The problem is, to add a product to cart user need to open the product first, it’s cost one step that is not necessary because most of the time, in their second purchase they already know the details. Restaurants also stock their items by purchasing them periodically and they can’t figure out how to repeat their purchases.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Process in crafting the design</p>
	<h3>I created flow,  sketch design and keep the iterative feedback loop with the team</h3>
	<p>Armed with the insights, I ideate the possible solutions. I spent the time sketching user flow. Then I invited my mentor and stakeholders to discussed the solutions area. I continue to create wireframe and architecture information that later I ask the team for feedback. I always do iterative feedback loop with stakeholders at every design steps to make sure we were still aligned and gather their point of views about the design. As we agreed on the wireframe design, I made it into a high-fidelity design prototype and evalute it to 4 customer acquisition team. From the usability testing user representative able to perform the task with some usabillity note that i fixed in the next step. </p>

	<h3>The key designs</h3>
	<img src="/assets/image/porto/bukamodal-2.png" class="full-width" />
	<b>Add to chart with few steps</b>
	<p class="space-down-16">In the previous version of the application, users need to enter the detail product page and click add to cart then click back and repeat the process. To support user behaviour purchasing more than 1 item in one checkout. The new design enable user to choose multiple products from listing, no needs to see details page over and over again</p>	
	<b>Reorder in one click</b>
	<p class="space-down-16">Previously user can't reorder, they need to repeat their buying process. I enable user to reorder in their history order</p>
	<b>Refreshing User Interface</b>
	<p class="space-down-16">I redesign the user interface to feel more lighter</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Outcomes</p>
	<h3>One quarter after the release, the product had disbursed 2X (Twice) total loan amount of the business team manual proof of concept project’s amount generated.</h3>
	<p>A seller testimonies who get the fund they needed to grow their business</p>
	<p>"Quite good, the process is quick from entering data for submission, until sending it to partners. The capital is also useful to help fund sales turnover "</p>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Main takeaway</p>
	<h3>I wish I’d collaborated with engineers and partners earlier to have scalable design</h3>
	<p> I got feedback from engineers when the design was almost finished. As the consequences, in technical system design, we have kinda lousy structured and need to refactor them later. Working on a financial technology product that highly regulated needs multiple alignments with multidisciplinary teams, from legal to the data security department. I wish I get an invite to the partners meeting earlier to get align effeciently.</p>
