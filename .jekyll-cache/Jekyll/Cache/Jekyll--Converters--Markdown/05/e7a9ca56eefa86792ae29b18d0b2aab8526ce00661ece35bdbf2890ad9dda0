	<p class="section-porto space-up-16">Aktro aims to educate people about the importance of energy conservation, and how to start conserving energy at home in this technology era. This project is crafted for HCIuxID  competition. I collaborated with 2 of my university colleges. Mostly we conducted every step together, but the deliverable design was made by me and my friend, Mutia.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Problem background</p>
	<h3>Need of electricity and water is increasing day by day, but it is not followed by the increasing of their availability.</h3>
	<p>For the last decade (2003-2013), the level of energy consumption in Indonesia has been going through an increase. The number rises from 79 tonnes of oil equivalent (TOE) to 134 TOE, equivalent to an average of 5,5% increase per year. The consequences of it might be electricity and water crisis that will be bad as energies are an essential need in the life of the current generation. </p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Define direction based on user problems</p>
	<h3>To solve the issue we are  targeting people who has control over their energy bills and usages</h3>
	<p>The users are someone who has control over their energy bills and usages such as homeowners, household members, property managers, or anyone looking to monitor their water and electricity consumption. </p>
	<br />
	<b>Objective</b>
	<br />
	Encourage households to conserve energy and manage their electricity and water consumption with the help of technology.&lt;/p&gt;	
	<br />
	<b>We interviewed with 5 participants and figured out</b>
	<p>The targeted users have the willingness to cut their energy consumptions. However they don't know what to save, they only know how much costs they spend each month from the bill. </p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Define other stakeholders </p>
	<h3>We believed to build an application for mass benefits we needs to map suitable stakeholders to collaborate and support the product</h3>
	<p>We identify our potential stakeholders are</p>	
	<li>PLN as the only electricity provider in Indonesia, own by the government</li>
	<li>PDAM as one of water supplier in Indonesia, own by the government</li>
	<li>Ministry of Environment and Forestry or Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources as the regulator who supports energy conservations</li>

	<p class="section-subheader">Concept design</p>
	<h3>Designing solutions to address needs and formulating monetisation models</h3>
	<b>How might we encourage users to reduce their consumption?</b>
		<li>Enable user to see their energy consumptions information both for water and electricity  in real time to give them awareness when increased usage occurs.</li>
		<li>Enable users to compare their electricity and water bills to know one of their usage consequences</li>
		<li>Motivare users whose succed to decrease their consumption with reward. For each decrease in water or electricity usage, the user will gain points. The accumulated points can then be exchanged for various rewards in forms of vouchers or gifts.</li>
		<li>Periodically inform users on the risk of wasting energy for environment</li>
	<b>How might we help users manage their energy consumption?</b>
		<li>Enable user to pay their water and electricity bills, so everything about energy management in one place to increase their awareness</li>
		<li>Enable user to set limit and target of their consumptions, so they know what to achive</li>
		<li>Educate users on how to manage their energy consumptions effectively, so they know can create their action points</li>
	<b>How might we monetize the apps?</b>
		<p>We think of partnering with stakeholders that we stated previously. The rewards system and cost might be come from the government funds. </p>
	<b>System design</b>
	<br />
	We talked with PLN representative to understand feasibility of system and created the diagram below.

	<h3>The design</h3>
	<p>You can interect with the prototype below. It's in Indonesia language.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Main takeaway and future works</p>
	<h3>Designing products for public and non-commercial intention needs a lot of iteartions</h3>
	<p>I learn that designing products for people goods needs a lot of aspects to think about. I believe the design needs further iterations, it can be a pilot testing or research with a broad participants. We still have bunch of questions without answers.</p>
