I"u<h1>Hi, I'm Mila! ðŸŒ»</h1>
<p>
	I'm currently working as a UX designer in the design system team at Bukalapak. I am passionate to learn about strategic product design, especially on social and business aspects. I have this huge curiosity on how design can bring impact to issues I care about: women &amp; children's rights and environmental sustainability. While that is my main interest, in 2020 I will focus on honing my 'abstract to concrete' thinking and visual design skill. 

	When I'm not designing, I'm probably gardening, crafting art, reading, or watching Korean drama.  I'm on my journey to build my own studio room at home, simply because I love art tools and art itself even though I'm not that good at creating ones (also because of the pandemic).  

	I'd love to chat about design and all the things related to my interests. Feel free to nudge me on my twitter.
