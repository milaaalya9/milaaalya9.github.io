I was one of three designers in the design system team. In this project, mainly responsible to coordinate and execute the system transformation supervised by the head of design</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Problem background</p>
	<h3>With 40+ products, that keeps on growing, our system is having a hard time catch up </h3>
	<p>After one year with a centralized model where Core Bazaar Team makes components, we observe the system have been stale and encounter problems. The signal is our team which is low in number canâ€™t keep up with products demands that keep on increasing.</p>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Understanding system user problems</p>
	<h3>System users feel Bazaar components are not sufficient and invent non-reusable new components</h3>
	<p>I interviewed 3 engineers and 3 designers to understand their current struggle. I found out system users..</p>
	<li>Feel like using components that not necessarily optimized for their product-specific needs  and decided to create their own component in feature. Thus resulting in tons of component divergence that can't be reused directly.
	</li>
	<li> Want to reuse components from other squads that are not in Bazaar. So, they copy-paste the code, and this is not scalable when update is made.</li>

	<p class="section-subheader">Solution</p>
	<h3>A capital loan aggregator</h3>
	<p class="space-down-24">Our team decided to build a platform providing various loan offers from different trusted providers, so sellers can choose the fund they needed in one place.</p>	
	<b>Objective</b>
	<p class="space-down-16"> Enable sellers get the fund they needed with shorter process and and a higher chance to be approved, so they can elevate their business.</p>
	<b>Success metrics</b>
	<li> 
	Number of sellers get a capital loan from our platform </li>
	<li> 
	The revenue we receive from partners based on loan disbursed amount</li>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Process in crafting the design</p>
	<h3>I facilitated whiteboarding co-creation, design, and iterate it based on various feedbacks</h3>
	<p>Together with PM, APM, and the Researcher we created the user flow in the whiteboard. After consolidating our favorite wire flow, I sketch wireframe design to demonstrate product value propositions that matched seller needs. I consulted multiple times to the product and business team, to make sure it was suitable for the business model since Fintech has a tight regulation.
	I proceeded to created high-fidelity prototype. Later, I gathered another round of feedback from other designers, the team, stakeholders, and partners. In pararell, the researcher and I conducted usability and concept testing to 5 sellers. After the testing, I revised the design based on issues finding before handing it to the engineering team.</p>

	<h3>The key designs</h3>
	<img src="/assets/image/porto/bukamodal-2.png" class="full-width" />
	<b>Landing page</b>
	<p class="space-down-16">Above the fold, I highlighted what they can do with additional fund, and a recommendation button as the call to action that will take them to know the  potential amount they can get based on their selling transaction. I also sneak peeks 3 of benefit using our platform that reflects sellers' current struggles in getting funded.</p>	
	<b>Loan listing</b>
	<p class="space-down-16">Sellers have a lot of things to consider, and to compare offers easily, I decided to display the main information in the card, summarize secondary information in accordion, and put details that are less important &amp; will not contribute to the choosing process in a link to another page. The design enables them to compare in one page.</p>
	<b>Application form</b>
	<p class="space-down-16">The application form is quite challenging because it requires users to input a lot of data and itâ€™s hard to avoid. As I thought it will be overwhelming for user to fill it all at one go, I divided the KYC forms into three processes with 1 scroll for each forms to make it feel short in term of number of steps and questions per-page and user can get small win in each steps.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Outcomes</p>
	<h3>One quarter after the release, the product had disbursed 2X (Twice) total loan amount of the business team manual proof of concept projectâ€™s amount generated.</h3>
	<p>A seller testimonies who get the fund they needed to grow their business</p>
	<p>"Quite good, the process is quick from entering data for submission, until sending it to partners. The capital is also useful to help fund sales turnover "</p>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Main takeaway</p>
	<h3>I wish Iâ€™d collaborated with engineers and partners earlier to have scalable design</h3>
	<p> I got feedback from engineers when the design was almost finished. As the consequences, in technical system design, we have kinda lousy structured and need to refactor them later. Working on a financial technology product that highly regulated needs multiple alignments with multidisciplinary teams, from legal to the data security department. I wish I get an invite to the partners meeting earlier to get align effeciently.</p>
