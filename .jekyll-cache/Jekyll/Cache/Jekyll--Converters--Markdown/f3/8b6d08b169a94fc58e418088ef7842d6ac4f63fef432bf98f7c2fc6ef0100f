	<p class="paragraph space-down-60">Stoqo enables restaurant owners to buy their stock remotely and estimated correctly. As a User Experience Designer, I crafted the design by  collaborating with the cross-functional team. I researched, analyzed, sketch, and prototype the design.</p>

	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Problem background</p>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-12">It takes several unnecessary steps for the restaurant owner to constantly purchase their stocks</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-60">While fixing that problem is the main goal of this project, the stakeholders decided to expand the scope of the project to be finding current applications problems which have a significant impact for users, prioritize and find a way to solve it.</p>

	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Understanding restaurant owners need</p>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-12">I discovered the product haven't addressed restaurant owner's repeated purchase need when it's important to make them loyal</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-60">I Interviewed users by phone and spoke with the team that has high-intensity interaction with users such as the acquisition and customer service team to get user problems. I also analyze current usage from the data funnel tracker. From the data, I can know where the user drops and the pattern of the user journey.
	<br />
	I learn, users usually purchase more than 1 item in one checkout, and to add a product to the cart user needs to open the product first, itâ€™s cost one step that is not necessary. Especially, most of the time, in their second purchase they already know the details. Restaurants also stock their items by purchasing them periodically and they canâ€™t figure out how to repeat their purchases.</p>

<div class="container">
	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Process in crafting the design</p>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-12">I created flow,  sketched, and keep on iterate the design through feedback and insights</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-60">Armed with the insights, I ideated the possible solutions. I spent the time sketching user flow. Then I invited my mentor and stakeholders to discussed the solutions area. I continue to create wireframe and architecture information that later I ask the team for feedback. I always do iterative feedback loop with stakeholders at every design steps to make sure we were still aligned and gathered their point of views about the design. As we agreed on the design, I made it into a high-fidelity design prototype and evaluate it to 4 customer acquisition team. Then I improved the design based on insights</p>

<div class="container">
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-12">The key designs</p>
	<p class="body--bolder">Add to chart with fewer steps</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-24">In the previous version of the application, users need to enter the detail product page and click add to cart then click back and repeat the process. To support user behavior purchasing more than 1 item in one checkout. The new design enables users to choose multiple products from listing, no needs to see details page over and over again</p>

	<p class="body--bolder">Reorder in one click</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-24">Previously users can't reorder, they need to repeat their buying process. I enable users to reorder in their history order</p>

	<p class="body--bolder">Vibrant user interface design and spaces used effectively</p>

<div class="container">
	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Outcome</p>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-12">Back in the middle of 2018, the design was released. Up to the end of 2019, it is still being used and the application has been download by 50k+ people.</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-60">I sadly canâ€™t know the precise impact since I was no longer in the company when the revamp rolled out</p>
