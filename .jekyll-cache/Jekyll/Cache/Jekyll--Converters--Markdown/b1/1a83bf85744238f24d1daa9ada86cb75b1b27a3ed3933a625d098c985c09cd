	<h3>The capital loan problems, the fast-growth of SME  and fintech industry </h3>
	<p>Bukalapak has approximately 3 million small-medium business (SME)  joining as online sellers. Based on research, SMEâ€™s in Indonesia struggling to get a capital loan to grow their business. On the other side, there was an increasing growth of loan providers with the presence of financial technology (fintech), with a mission to increase financial inclusion toward SME by providing productive loans with less requirement than the bank. Our challenge is  How might we support our sellers to get the fund they needed so they can elevate their business?</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Understanding seller needs</p>
	<h3>Our seller need to get a capital loan to expand their business, but they were struggling</h3>
	<p>The UX researcher interviewed 5 sellers with the help of mine as an observer. From the research, we know for sure seller needs additional funds to add stocks and expand there business. They have tried to get loan but it requires a bunch of documents that difficult to comply with and have back and forth steps. Those struggles plus low chances of getting approved hindered them from getting a capital loan, and that slowing their business growth.
We are able to create a as-is scenario based on the research and analyze our competitors further. From all the knowledge that we have, we can know what kind of value propositions we can offer to our users.</p>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Solution</p>
	<h3>A capital loan aggregator</h3>
	<p>Our team decided to build a platform providing various loan offers from different trusted providers, so sellers can choose the fund they needed in one place. As another value proposition, we will provide shorter steps of application process and a higher chance to be approved with loan recommendations based on  their selling transactions.</p>	
	<b>Objective</b>
	<p> Enable sellers get the fund they needed with shorter process, so they can elevate their business.</p>
	<b>Success metrics</b>
	<li> 
	Number of sellers get a capital loan from our platform </li>
	<li> 
	The revenue we receive from partners based on loan disbursed amount</li>
	<b>The minimum viable products</b>
	<p>Due to the limited resources, short amount of time, partner capability, and the impact sellers &amp; businesses would get, in the first phase, we have to make it as minimum as possible. So, we will only support sellers until the fund gets transferred to their account in the product's first release, the rest will be handled in the partner platform.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Process in creating the design</p>
	<h3>Facilitated whiteboarding co-creation, design, and iterate it based on various feedbacks</h3>
	<p>Together with PM, APM, and the Researcher we created the user flow in the whiteboard. After consolidating our favorite wire flow,  I explored wireframe design to demonstrate product value propositions that matched seller needs. I consulted multiple times to the product and business team, to make sure it was suitable for the business model since Fintech has a tight regulation.
	I proceeded to the high-fidelity design after that and created clickable prototype. Later, I gathered another round of feedback from other designers, the team, stakeholders, and partners. In pararell, the researcher and I conducted usability and concept testing to 5 sellers. After the testing, I revised the design based on issues finding before handing it to the engineering team.</p>
