	<h1>In the middle of 2020 grief</h1>

<p>I can’t believe I finished coding my website.</p>

<p>I have been dreaming of having my website, code by myself from the last semester of college. But it’s hard to finish one. Here it is, the output of my intense googling CSS skill in 4 days during the weird pandemic era.</p>

<p>The actual plan of the website is to showcase my work portfolio, but I gotta start with the most enjoyable part first, which is casual blogging. You will find some writing about things that I’m interested in here, which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design, mostly my learning in UX but I also want to explore more than that</li>
  <li>Craft and Art, I love to do this on the weekend</li>
  <li>Social issues, I decided focusing my attention to child, women, and environmental issue</li>
  <li>Learning takeaway from books and event that I attend to</li>
  <li>Life lesson, a reflection notes from my personal experiences.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goals of having this blog for me are</p>

<ul>
  <li>Structuring my thought through writing</li>
  <li>Level up my writing and English skill, my linguistic skill is quite poor (like in every language), and English proficiency is a must to survive</li>
  <li>I also would love to see my personal view growth through my writing</li>
</ul>

<p>By writing this post, I hope I can be hold responsible to constantly writing (2 week for 2 writing) and learning.</p>

<p>In the middle of 2020 grief with a lot of failed plan, I wish to move on and embrace the uncomfortable situation. Cheers for more writing and reading time!</p>
