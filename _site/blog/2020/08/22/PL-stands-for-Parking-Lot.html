	<h1>Pl stands for parking lot</h1>

<p>Whenever I have finished an activity that required much thinking, I will have one or two lingering questions in my mind. In the past, I would try to find an overview answer right away, or… write it in my notebook, left it hanging, and later, I forgot about it. The sad fact the questions buried with my other messy hand-writing.<br />
Therefore, I decided to take notes of the questions on my notion page, and write a blog post on questions that I think important for me to figure out the answer. The post purpose is simply to hold me accountable.
It will have “PL” tag in the title. I will put my question into a narrative, breakdown the questions, and put my wandering thoughts. Later when I found out the answer I will update it and iterate it whenever I gain new knowledge.</p>
