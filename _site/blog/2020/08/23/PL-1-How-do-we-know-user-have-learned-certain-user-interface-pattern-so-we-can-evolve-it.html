	<h1>Pl #1  how do we know user have learned certain user interface pattern so we can evolve it?</h1>

<p>On one of a component collaboration checkpoints, my coworker showed me an Instagram interface to support his design rationale. Previously they used a button link with blue color but currently, they changed the color to black. He argued, “I think users (people who used tech in general) must have learned and recognized button link, shouldn’t we also opt to this approach and no longer use that old button link best practice?”. At the time, I honestly didn’t know what is the answer to the questions, so I decided to drop other questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Should we conclude that Instagram design decisions based on the user that is the same as ours?</li>
  <li>How do we know “users have learned button link” so that to perceive link is clickable we don’t need any more signifier?</li>
</ol>

<p>On a bigger picture and wider context, I think his question is interesting to discuss. So I reframe and breakdown the questions: 
How do we know users have learned a certain pattern to the point we don’t need to put extra signifier and evolve the design into simpler form?
Why is it beneficial to know this and evolve the design?
While rereading the case, I just remember design, in general, has grown over time. As I recall, in the early phase of technology development, I remember most of user interface design has a skeuomorphic design mimicking the physical object. As for now, the design is evolving into a much simpler form and clean. For example, a button is no longer seen with embossing details, only a simple rectangle, but users already know it can be click. 
Does the transformation happen because designers know that users have learned a button and other design elements so they can opt to evolve the design to a much simpler object? Or designers just experimenting with the design and figure out the simpler design work better at one point in time?</p>

<p>So how do we know users have learned so we can evolve the design in a better direction? What kind of research that we need to conduct to know that?</p>

<p>All I can think of for now is Usability testing and perhaps experiment in the form of A/B test. Might need to do some research on the net to figure out the answer.</p>
