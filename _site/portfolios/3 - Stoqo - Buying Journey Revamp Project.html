<div class="section-porto">
	<p>Stoqo enables restaurant owners to buy their stock remotely and estimated correctly.As a User Experience Designer, I crafted the design by  collaborating with the cross-functional team. I researched, analyzed, sketch and prototype the design.</p>
	<h5 class="space-up-16">Team</h5>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="two-column team"> 
				<li>Angky as CTO</li>
				<li>Natasha as Business lead</li>
		</div>
		<div class="two-column team"> 
				<li>Jessica as UX Designer (Mentor)</li>
				<li>Irfan as Engineer</li>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Problem background</p>
	<h3>It takes several unnecessary steps for restaurant owner to constantly purchase their stocks</h3>
	<p>While fixing that problem is the main goal of this project, the stakeholders decided to expand the scope of the project to be finding current applications problems which have significant impact for user, prioritize and find a way to solve it.</p>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Understanding restaurant owner needs</p>
	<h3>I found, the product have not address restaurant owner repeated purchase needs which is important to make them a loyal customer</h3>
	<p>I Interviewed user by phone and spoke with the team that has high-intensity interaction with users such us the acquisition and customer service team to get user problems. I also analyze current usage from the data funnel tracker. From the data, I can know where the user drops and the pattern of the user journey.
	<br />
	I discovered, users usually purchase more than 1 item in one checkout and to add a product to cart user need to open the product first, it’s cost one step that is not necessary. Especially, most of the time, in their second purchase they already know the details. Restaurants also stock their items by purchasing them periodically and they can’t figure out how to repeat their purchases.</p>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Process in crafting the design</p>
	<h3>I created flow,  sketch design and keep the iterative feedback loop with the team</h3>
	<p>Armed with the insights, I ideated the possible solutions. I spent the time sketching user flow. Then I invited my mentor and stakeholders to discussed the solutions area. I continue to create wireframe and architecture information that later I ask the team for feedback. I always do iterative feedback loop with stakeholders at every design steps to make sure we were still align and gathered their point of views about the design. As we agreed on the design, I made it into a high-fidelity design prototype and evalute it to 4 customer acquisition team. Then I improved the design based on insights</p>	
</div>
<div class="section-porto">
	<h3>The key designs</h3>
	<b>Add to chart with fewer steps</b>
	<p class="space-down-16">In the previous version of the application, users need to enter the detail product page and click add to cart then click back and repeat the process. To support user behaviour purchasing more than 1 item in one checkout. The new design enable user to choose multiple products from listing, no needs to see details page over and over again</p>

	<b>Reorder in one click</b>
	<p class="space-down-16">Previously user can't reorder, they need to repeat their buying process. I enable user to reorder in their history order</p>
	<img src="/assets/image/porto/stoqo-3.png" class="img-follow" />
	<b>More vibrant user interface design</b>
	<p class="space-down-16">I redesign the user interface to feel more lighter</p>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Outcomes</p>
	<h3>Back in the middle of 2018, the design released. Up to now it still being used and the application has been download by 50k+ people.</h3>
	<p>I sadly can’t know the precise impact since, I was no longer in the company when the revamp rolled out</p>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Main takeaway</p>
	<h3>I wish I can meet user directly</h3>
	<p>This is my first time in conducting user research. Talking to user by phone interview and have a conversation with user representative has been insightful, back then i always wish to meet them directly to know the real operation and situation to get more context.</p>
