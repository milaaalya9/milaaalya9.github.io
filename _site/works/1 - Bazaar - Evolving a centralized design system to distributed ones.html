<div class="section-porto">
	<p>Bazaar is Bukalapak’s Design System. After one year with a centralized model where Core Bazaar Team makes components, our system is on stale and having a hard time catching up 40+ products' need that keeps on growing. I was one of three designers in the design system team. In this project, I responsible to think, coordinate and execute the system transformation supervised by the head of design</p>

	<h3>I Interviewed system users and found that they invent non-reusable new components</h3>
	<p>From 3 engineers and 3 designers that I interviewed, I found system users..</p>
	<li>Feel like using components that not necessarily optimized for their product-specific needs and decided to create their own component in features. Thus resulting in tons of component divergence that can't be reused directly.
	</li>
	<li> Want to reuse components from other squads that are not in Bazaar. So, they copy-paste the code, and this is not scalable when an update is made.</li>
	<p>Our system also is not designed to make squads accustomed to working on components by themself and share it with each other.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Objective and key results</p>
	<h3>We want to enable system users create and use each other components</h3>
	<p class="space-down-24">With all the insights on our hands, we regrouped and align on the objective. As for the key result is to have a system and service that able to add reusable and cohesive components from system users in our system. After knowing what we want, all the coordination and execution were my responsibility.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Process crafting the system</p>
	<h3>I explored two ecosystem models that aim for scalability</h3>
	<p>The design question that I try to answer is “How might the system enable squads to reuse each other components?”. I investigated the design of our products and discovered some products trying to solve similar problems and have similar patterns. I conclude it will be good if squads in a group strive to solve the same problem hand by hand, in an ecosystem that we have provided. Thus I propose creating a library for a group of products. The 1st model group fewer products than the second model. After we assessed the options based on technical, design, and people aspects,  we choose the 2nd type because the potential components in each them and the ratio of people working on it are optimal. I proceed to create the guild and check whether our hypothesis is right.</p>

	<p class="section-subheader">Test the model</p>
	<h3>Validated the model by conducting workshops</h3>
	<p>To check whether the guild will have reusable and optimize specific components, I conducted two workshops. First, with design system designers, we collected product screens in one group as a sample and jotted down which components that can be optimized and used together. We found a lot, and it’s interesting as mostly it was a molecule component.
	<br />
	Second, to verify does each guild will have reusable components, I facilitated a workshop with all of the UX designers as the participants. The result, each guild has components. After this, we are confident in moving forward with the project.</p>

	<h3>I delivered process, coordinate ambassadors and communicate the system changes</h3>
	<p>Next, I need to think about how might we enable people to adopt the new design system ecosystem and created an intentional component independently?</p>
	<br />
	<b>Build Process</b>
	<br />
	<p>For designer, I co-created with the team framework to discover reusable components and principles to create components. For engineer we make sure the process from handoff design to code area smooth, where and how squad engineer put their component, the review process, and how the core team can monitor the system.</p>
	<br />
	<b>Recruit Ambassador</b>
	<br />
	<p>We recruite a designer as design system ambassador for each guild. They responsible to facilitate collaboration inside the guild, connect guild with core team, and maintain the quality of guild library.  To collaborate closely with us, I arrange ambassador weekly check-in to exchange knowledges about design systems and product experiences</p>
	<br />
	<b>Communication strategy</b>
	<p>
	I took some time designing how to communicate the new design system to the whole company with the help of the head of design. We thought about the terms, explain it in function biweekly, and other media such as chat, email, our documentation website, and all with video attached. We don’t want anyone to miss the information.

	<p class="section-subheader">An overview of the new Bazaar Ecosystem</p>
	<h3>Bazaar now consists of 3 fundamental elements, with the presence of Guild libraries</h3>
	<p> First, <b>Bazaar token</b>, it inherently constitutes Bukalapak as a brand through typography, color, and other base elements. Then, <b>Bazaar library</b> - A collection of common components shared across products in Bukalapak.</p>
	<br />
	<b>The new one is the Guild library</b>
	<p>A collection of specific components that are being used by a certain group of products/features with similar requirements or user problems to solve. Currently, we have 8 Guilds with around 10 products in the guild. When a guild need other guild components, the component will be transformed into Bazaar library components</p>
	<br />
	<b>Build with a governance system</b>
	<p>The core team manages bazaar token and library and system users manage the guild library. Each of us can contribute to one library or another.

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Outcome</p>
	<h3>Several components were added to our system, more components are on progress!</h3>
	<p>After almost two months, some components were added to our new system. Also, we get enthusiasm from our team:
		<br />
		“I’m excited working on my guild library” - a guild ambassador
		<br />
		“Hey, I think this component can be a guild component” - a squad engineer
	</p>
</div>

<div class="section-porto">
	<p class="section-subheader">Ongoing work</p>
	<h3>Increasing the guild library adoption with guild initiatives</h3>
	<p>In an effort to have a cohesive product, we need to tidy up the old messy components. I am working with the ambassadors and their managers on creating a strategy to improve their design components and aligning it with the product squad timeline, so they can ship it to users and have a massive, incremental impact.

	<p class="section-subheader">Main takeaway</p>
	<h3>Zooming in and out throughout the process has helped me navigate in this project that was filled with abstraction. </h3>
	<p>I am very grateful that my head gave me the opportunity to lead this project as I touch a lot of areas that are new to me. In the journey, I sometimes lost whenever I go in too deep. I’m glad that I know whenever I get lost, I need to zoom out and find a helpful resource. </p>
