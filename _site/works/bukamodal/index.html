	  <h1 class="title-post">Bukamodal - A Productive Loan Aggregator for Online Seller</h1>
  </div>

<div class="container">
	<p class="paragraph space-down-42">After graduated from college I started my fulltime design journey in a small new team aim to make financial product accessible for everyone. I work as a User Experience Designer, facilitated design process and crafted the design.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Problem background and opportunity</p>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-12">The capital loan problems, the fast-growth of SME  and fintech industry </p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-60">Bukalapak has approximately 3 million small-medium business (SME)  joining as online sellers. Based on research, SME’s in Indonesia struggling to get a capital loan to grow their business. On the other side, there was an increasing growth of loan providers with the presence of financial technology (fintech), with a mission to increase financial inclusion toward SME by providing productive loans with less requirement than the bank. Our challenge is, <b>How might we support our sellers to get the fund they needed so they can elevate their business? </b></p>	
</div>

<div class="container">
	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Understanding current sellers condition</p>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-12">To get capital loan sellers need to comply with difficult steps and requirements</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-60">The UX researcher interviewed 5 sellers with the help of mine as an observer. Turned out sellers have tried to get a loan but it requires a bunch of documents that difficult to comply with and have back and forth steps. Those struggles plus low chances of getting approved hindered them from getting a capital loan, and that slowing their business growth. We are able to create a as-is scenario based on the research and analyze our competitors further.</p>

<div class="container">
	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Solution</p>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-12">A capital loan aggregator</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-24">Our team decided to build a platform providing various loan offers from different trusted providers, so sellers can choose the fund they needed in one place.</p>	
	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Objective</p>
	<p class="space-down-24 paragraph"> Enable sellers get the fund they needed with shorter process and and a higher chance to be approved, so they can elevate their business.</p>
	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Success metrics</p>
	<ul class="paragraph space-down-60">
		<li>Number of sellers get a capital loan from our platform </li>
		<li>The revenue we receive from partners based on loan disbursed amount</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="container">
	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Process in crafting the design</p>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-12">I facilitated whiteboarding co-creation, design, and iterate it based on various feedbacks</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-60">Together with PM, APM, and the Researcher we created the user flow in the whiteboard. After consolidating our favorite wire flow, I sketch wireframe design to demonstrate product value propositions that matched seller needs. I consulted multiple times to the product and business team, to make sure it was suitable for the business model since Fintech has a tight regulation.
	I proceeded to created high-fidelity prototype. Later, I gathered another round of feedback from other designers, the team, stakeholders, and partners. In pararell, the researcher and I conducted usability and concept testing to 5 sellers. After the testing, I revised the design based on issues finding before handing it to the engineering team.</p>

<div class="container">
	<p class="subheading space-down-24">The key designs</p>
</div>
<p><img src="/assets/image/porto/bukamodal-2.png" class="section" /></p>
<div class="container">
	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Landing page</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-24">Above the fold, I highlighted what they can do with additional fund, and a recommendation button as the call to action that will take them to know the  potential amount they can get based on their selling transaction. I also sneak peeks 3 of benefit using our platform that reflects sellers' current struggles in getting funded.</p>
	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Loan listing</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-24">Sellers have a lot of things to consider, and to compare offers easily, I decided to display the main information in the card, summarize secondary information in accordion, and put details that are less important &amp; will not contribute to the choosing process in a link to another page. The design enables them to compare in one page.</p>
	<img src="/assets/image/porto/bukamodal-3a.png" class="section space-down-42" />
	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Application form</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-24">The application form is quite challenging because it requires users to input a lot of data and it’s hard to avoid. As I thought it will be overwhelming for user to fill it all at one go, I divided the KYC forms into three processes with 1 scroll for each forms to make it feel short in term of number of steps and questions per-page and user can get small win in each steps.</p>

<div class="container">
	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Outcomes</p>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-12">One quarter after the release, the product had disbursed 2X (Twice) total loan amount of the business team manual proof of concept project’s amount generated.</p>
	<p class="paragraph">A seller testimonies who get the fund they needed to grow their business</p>
	<p class="paragraph">"Quite good, the process is quick from entering data for submission, until sending it to partners. The capital is also useful to help fund sales turnover "</p>
	<hr class="separator" />
</div>
<div class="container">
	<p class="body--smaller-bold">Main takeaway</p>
	<p class="subheading paragraph space-down-12">I wish I’d collaborated with engineers and partners earlier to have scalable design</p>
	<p class="paragraph space-down-80"> I got feedback from engineers when the design was almost finished. As the consequences, in technical system design, we have kinda lousy structured and need to refactor them later. Working on a financial technology product that highly regulated needs multiple alignments with multidisciplinary teams, from legal to the data security department. I wish I get an invite to the partners meeting earlier to get align effeciently.</p>
