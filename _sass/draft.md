Last week, my friend invited me to attend a webinar event. Honestly, I don't have any expectation toward the event and I doesn't have that much interest in the topic but i join anyway because my friend usually recommends me only the good ones. Turned out it was real good.

The event organized by Spark and Idea fest with Leadership as their main topic. I specially love Azelea Ayuningtyas story, she's the co-founder of duanyam a social-entreperneurship.
